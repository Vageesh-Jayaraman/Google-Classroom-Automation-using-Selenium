## Google Classroom Automation using Selenium

**Introduction**

This Python script is designed to automate tasks on Google Classroom, specifically targeting teachers who faced difficulties running online classes during the COVID-19 pandemic. It utilizes Selenium for web automation, tkinter for the user interface,  _the deep_translator module for translation purposes (Just an additional feature )_. User credentials are stored in CSV files for authentication.

**Prerequisites**

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:
1. Python (>= 3.6)
2. Selenium
3. Tkinter
4. deep_translator

_**Note: The pip commands are provided in the PIP.txt file**_


**Limitations**

1. **Dynamic XPath:** Google Classroom's XPath for links may change frequently, causing the script to fail. Regularly update the XPath values as needed.
2. **Password Encryption:** Passwords are stored in plain text in the CSV file, which is not secure. Consider implementing password encryption for improved security.
